config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAPS_PATH
    string "Absolute path to a .wav file containing clap audio"
    default "claps.wav"
    help
        Absolute path to a .wav file containing clap audio, this file can
        contain multiple claps which will get sliced up according to the
        VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAP_NUMBER configuration option.

config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAP_BITRATE
    int "Bitrate of the audio sample to use for storing clap audio"
    default 100
    help
        Bitrate of the audio sample to use for storing clap audio. A naive
        downsampling algorithm is used to reduce the bitrate of the given
        wave file before storing on the device. Larger values give more audio
        information but take up more space.

        It's worth noting that a high bitrate is not required to determine
        peak amplitude/distance

config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAP_SAMPLES_BEFORE
    int "Number of samples before clap to include in window"
    default 30

config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAP_SAMPLES_AFTER
    int "Number of samples after clap to include in window"
    default 170

config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_CLAP_NUMBER
    int "Integer index of which clap to use"
    default 0
    help
        Integer index of which clap to use out of claps.wav, these are
        found by naive peak detection after downsampling, clap 0 indicates
        the strongest peak, clap 1, indicates the second strongest peak, etc.

config VC_AUDIO_EVENT_TRIANGULATION_DELAY
    int "Artificial delay to introduce for demo purposes"
    default 0
    help
        Artificial delay to introduce for demo purposes, given in seconds.
